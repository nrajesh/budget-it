**Image Prompt for "Budget It!" Podcast Cover**

**Subject:** A cinematic, high-contrast visualization of financial clarity cutting through chaos.

**Scene Description:**
The viewer is standing at the entrance of a dark, complex maze or a foggy crossroads made of stone walls, representing financial confusion and "lumpy" expenses. The lighting is dim, blue-grey, and misty.

However, cutting through the center of this dark maze is a single, vibrant, illuminated path. This path is glowing with a warm, golden-emerald light (representing the "Money GPS").

At the far end of this illuminated path, in the distance, is a brilliant source of light—a glowing "pot of gold" or a radiant golden sunrise breaking through the tunnel, symbolizing financial freedom and peace of mind.

**Style & Mood:**
- **Style:** 3D render, isometric or low-angle perspective, clean modern aesthetics mixed with a slight fantasy/adventure vibe.
- **Lighting:** Volumetric lighting, glowing path effects, deep shadows in the maze vs. bright light on the path.
- **Color Palette:** Dark Slate/Charcoal (Background/Maze) vs. Emerald Green & Gold (The Path/Goal).
