### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## Database Schema

The application interacts with several Supabase tables and functions, including:
*   `user_profile`: Stores user profile information.
*   `categories`: Manages transaction categories for users.
*   `vendors`: Stores vendor information, including accounts.
*   `transactions`: Records financial transactions.
*   `scheduled_transactions`: Manages recurring transactions.
*   `budgets`: Manages user budgets.

Several PostgreSQL functions are also used for data manipulation and aggregation, such as `handle_new_user`, `get_categories_with_transaction_counts`, `batch_upsert_accounts`, and more.
