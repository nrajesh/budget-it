# Personal Finance Tracker

A powerful and intuitive application designed to help you take control of your finances. Track your spending, manage budgets, and gain clear insights into your financial habits.

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Budgeting
Create and manage budgets with flexible frequencies to match your financial planning style.
- **Monthly:** For regular, recurring expenses like utilities or subscriptions.
- **Quarterly:** For expenses that occur every three months.
- **Yearly:** For annual costs like insurance premiums or memberships.
- **One-Time:** For specific, non-recurring goals like a vacation or a large purchase.

### 2. Detailed Transaction Tracking
Log all your transactions to see exactly where your money is going. Assign transactions to specific categories, vendors, and accounts for granular control.

### 3. Insightful Dashboard
The main dashboard provides a clear, at-a-glance overview of your financial health:
- **Avg. Monthly Budget:** See your total planned spending, normalized to a monthly figure for easy comparison. This calculation intelligently converts all budget frequencies (quarterly, yearly, etc.) into a single, understandable monthly average.
- **Avg. Monthly Spent:** Track your actual average monthly spending.
- **Avg. Monthly Remaining:** Instantly know how much you have left to spend or save. Budgets will show a negative balance if you overspend, giving you an honest and accurate picture of your habits.

### 4. Category & Payee Management
Organize your finances by creating custom spending categories and managing a list of payees (vendors and accounts). This helps you understand which areas of your life you spend the most on.

### 5. Account Management
Track balances across different financial accounts, such as checking, savings, or credit cards.
