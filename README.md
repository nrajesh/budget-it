## Features

### Core Functionality
*   **Dashboard**: An at-a-glance overview of your total balance, income vs. expenses, spending by category, recent financial activity, and overall budget health.
*   **Authentication**: Secure user registration and login powered by Supabase Auth. User profiles include personal details and avatars.
*   **Multi-Currency Support**: Set a default currency for reporting, with automatic conversion for transactions in different currencies.

### Transactions Management
*   **Full CRUD**: Easily view, add, edit, and delete financial transactions.
*   **Transfers**: Seamlessly handle transfers between accounts, including those with different currencies.
*   **Filtering & Search**: Powerful filtering by date range, accounts, categories, vendors, and a text search for remarks.
*   **Bulk Operations**: Delete multiple transactions at once.
*   **CSV Import/Export**: Easily import historical data or export your records.

### Scheduled Transactions
*   **Recurring Payments**: Define transactions with a specific start date, flexible frequency (e.g., every 2 weeks, every 1 month), and an optional end date.
*   **Automatic Processing**: Scheduled transactions are automatically processed and added to your main transaction list as their due dates pass, ensuring your records are always up-to-date.
*   **Future Visibility**: View upcoming scheduled transactions directly in the main transaction list, clearly marked and greyed out.

### Budgets Management
*   **Set Spending Targets**: Create budgets for specific categories with a target amount, currency, and frequency (e.g., monthly, weekly).
*   **Track Progress**: Monitor your spending against your budget targets in real-time.
*   **Flexible Periods**: Define start and end dates for your budgets, or let them run indefinitely.
*   **Active/Inactive Status**: Easily pause and resume budgets as your financial goals change.

### Entity Management
Dedicated pages to manage your financial entities with full CRUD, bulk deletion, and CSV import/export.
*   **Accounts**: Manage your bank accounts, credit cards, and investment funds. Each account has a starting balance and currency.
*   **Vendors**: Keep a list of payees you transact with, such as stores, utility companies, or individuals.
*   **Categories**: Organize your spending and income with customizable categories.

### Reporting Module
The reporting module is split into two sections, both equipped with powerful filtering capabilities and PDF export for tabular data.

#### Essential Reports
This section provides a clear overview of your current financial standing based on historical data.
*   **Net Worth Statement**: A snapshot of your financial health, summarizing total assets, liabilities, and your resulting net worth.
*   **Income & Expense Summary**: A detailed breakdown of your income and expenses by category, including variance against your budget targets.
*   **Trends and Analytics**: A visual bar chart that compares your monthly income versus expenses, with an overlay for your total budget target.

#### Advanced Reports
This section leverages both historical and future scheduled transactions to provide insightful projections.
*   **Trend Forecasting**: A line chart that analyzes your historical net income to project future trends, intelligently incorporating the impact of your scheduled transactions.
*   **Financial Flow (Sankey Chart)**: A powerful visualization that shows how your money movesâ€”from income sources, through your various accounts, and out to different expense categories.
*   **Alerts and Insights**: An automated analysis that provides low balance warnings based on upcoming scheduled transactions, highlights budget overrun risks, and shows your top spending categories, vendors, and active accounts.

### Settings
*   **Default Currency**: Set your preferred currency for all reports and summaries.
*   **Future Projections**: Configure how many months into the future the Advanced Reports should project data.
*   **Data Management**: Easily reset all application data or generate a comprehensive set of demo data to explore the app's features.
